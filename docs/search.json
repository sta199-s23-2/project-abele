However, one per data set is required.)\n\nWhat is the relationship between race and mortality rate and cancer types?\n\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\n\nHypotheses:\n\nDifferent racial groups have different mortality rates for the same type of cancer.\nThe impact of race and cancer type on mortality rates is influenced by other factors such as age and gender.\n\nResearch topic:\n\nThis research topic aims to explore the relationship between race, cancer type, and mortality among cancer patients. The first hypothesis suggests that mortality rates for the same type of cancer vary across different racial groups. For example, Black and Hispanic cancer patients may appear to have higher mortality rates for a certain type of cancer compared to White patients. The second hypothesis suggests that there are other factors such as age and gender that can impact the relationship between race, cancer type, and mortality rates. This research could potentially provide insights into how to improve cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment strategies for different racial groups and different types of cancer. \n\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question.

Negative binomial regression was used to analyze trends based on county for colorectal cancer mortality rates, adjusted for ender, race, and age for individuals above 35 years old. The results reveal that prior to 1980, there was a stable gradient in colorectal cancer morality, with higher SES counties at greater risk. However, beginning in 1980, this gradient began to narrow and then reversed as people living in higher SES counties experiences greater reductions in colorectal cancer mortality rates than those in lower SES countries. This supports the fundamental cause hypothesis, suggesting that social and economic resources are important factors in influencing mortality rates once knowledge about prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer became available.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nThis research question builds on the research given because it also explores the relationship between other cancer types– lung cancer and breast cancer– as well as colorectal cancer."

    "text": "Research question\n\nA well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project. However, one per data set is required.)\n\nHow does race affect the rate of opioid abuse death in the US?\n\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\n\nIn recent years, the United States has been afflicted by an opioid crisis which has seen opioid overdose deaths increase exponentially from 21,089 in 2010 to more than 106,000 in 2021. It has become one of the biggest killers in the U.S., especially of men. In light of this, we want to investigate whether race has an impact on the rate of opioid abuse death. We hypothesize that opioid abuse death will be most prevalent among White, Black and Hispanic people, and less prevalent among American Indian or Alaskan Native and Asian or Pacific Islander people.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\nRate.Opioid.Race.Hispanic\nRate.Opioid.Race.Asian or Pacific Islander\nRate.Opioid.Black\nRate.Opioid.White\nRate.Opioid.American Indian or Alaska Native\nRate.Opioid.Any.Total\nThese variables are all quantitative. All but the last one records the rate of overdose deaths among the specified racial group due to any opioid per 100,000 people. The final variable records the rate of overdose deaths due to any opioid per 100,000 people."

It found that death rates were higher for Black people and American Indian/Alaskan Native people. It also found that cocaine and opioid overdoses increased among Hispanic, White and Black people, as did psychostimulants overdoses.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nOur research question does not focus on cocaine and psychostimulant overdoses but instead opioid overdoses. It also considers data over a longer period of time, from 1999-2019 as opposed to 2004-2019. In this way, we hope to use this article to compare against opioid trends."
